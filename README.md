## Features

- Real-time character counting as users type.
- Displays total characters entered and remaining characters allowed.
- User-friendly interface with clear visual feedback.

## How it Works

The web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's how each component contributes to the functionality:

### HTML

The HTML file (`index.html`) defines the structure of the web page, including the text area for input and the containers to display character counts.

### CSS

The CSS file (`style.css`) provides the styling for different elements of the web application, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive layout.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript file (`script.js`) adds interactivity to the application. It listens for the `input` event on the text area, calculates the character count, and updates the display of the total and remaining characters in real-time.
